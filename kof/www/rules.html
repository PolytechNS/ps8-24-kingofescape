        <h1>King of Escape - Rules Sheet</h1>
        <p>Welcome to King of Escape! Below are the rules to help you navigate the game:</p>

        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>Be the first player to successfully escape the maze by reaching the opposite side. You need to escape before your opponent.</p>

        <h2>Setup:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player begins with:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pawn - representing their character</li>
                <li>10 fences - used to obstruct their opponent's progress</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Players select their starting positions along their respective edges of the board. This initial placement determines their starting point and strategy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Movement:</h2>
        <p>During their turn, players can move their pawn one square at a time, either vertically or horizontally. However, diagonal movement is prohibited.</p>

        <p>When two players find themselves adjacent to each other, one player has the option to leap over the opponent's square and continue their movement, thus gaining an advantage in reaching the opposite side more quickly.</p>

        <h2>Placing Fences:</h2>
        <p>Strategic placement of fences can significantly impede the opponent's progress. Fences can be placed horizontally or vertically on any unoccupied square of the board.</p>

        <p>It's crucial to note that players cannot completely block off a section of the board, ensuring that the opponent always has a pathway to reach the other side.</p>

        <p>Once a player exhausts their supply of fences, they are restricted to moving their pawn only, adding a layer of strategic depth as the game progresses.</p>

        <h2>Fog of War:</h2>
        <p>At the start of the game, each player's visibility is limited to their half of the board. The opponent's half remains hidden until it is reached.</p>
        <img src="./picture/rulesboard.png" alt="Fog of War Example">

        <p>Upon successfully advancing into the opponent's half, the player gains full visibility of the entire board, allowing for better strategic planning.</p>

        <h2>Victory:</h2>
        <p>The ultimate goal is to be the first player to successfully navigate through the maze-like board and reach the opposite side. Achieve this, and victory is yours!</p>
